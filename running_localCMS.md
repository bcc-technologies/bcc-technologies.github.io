# Paste this in your cmd:

~~~
cd admin-local
npm i
npm run dev
~~~

This will run a localhost with an UI to create content for the website, it could be a blog post, service addition or a product addition.
All will be saved in a local database and a gitpush will be made to make it be online in the repo. Make sure that you have nothing else to save before.

All core files are in admin-local and the content created is in the content folder.

# Working with non-technical staff

I'm planning to make an agent program that you can get as an .exe file or otherwise and gives you limited access to our repository for you to use the UI and modify the database, the program may help them handle the pushes and everything else via a non-technical interface and without giving them real access to the repo.
